# Misty
This webpage is dedicated to Misty, it's very basic in content but shows multiple features:
1) A button created with HTML and CSS
2) A gradient colour background that changes upon scrolling
3) Images aligned to the left and right with text wrapped to be displayed alongside them
4) An anchor link to Misty's Instagram page which is displayed as the Instagram icon rather than text

This project is not to be considered seriously but is more of an experimentation
